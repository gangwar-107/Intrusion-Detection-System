# Intrusion-Detection-System

It is our thesis project in which we developed an intrusion detection system and integrated it
with web application.This system classifies the traffic of a site as a normal traffic or a type of attack like DOS
attack,probe attack, teardrop attack.

### DOS Attack
In dos attack intruder sends large no. of requests on a server and exhausts all the
resources of the server so that legitimate users can't access the server.
### PROBE Attack
In this attack Intruder tries to gain access to the information and loopholes in the
system and later use this information for generating the attack.
### Teardrop Attack
In tear drop attack intruder modifies the requests packet.it modifies the sequence no. of request packets so it creates the problem in reassembling of the packets at
receiver and buffer is full and all other incoming packets are discarded.
